/**
 * Represents a chessboard. Can be initialized through use of the
 * initialize(FileOutputStream stream) method, where stream is an open
 * board data file. <br>
 * <br>
 * Board data files are formatted as follows. 
 * First there are 4 lines, each of which contains a single digit; either 0 or 1.
 * They represent boolean values (0 false, 1 true) and should be interpreted as follows:
 * 
 * whiteCanQueensideCastle
 * whiteCanKingsideCastle
 * blackCanQueensideCastle
 * blackCanKingsideCastle
 *
 * Where "colourCanQueensideCastle" means that colour's King hasn't
 * moved this game, and neither has colour's Queenside Rook. Similarly for
 * colourCanKingsideCastle. This information needs to be stored in files,
 * because it can't always be gleaned from just looking at the board whether
 * or not a piece has moved, as it could have done so and returned to its initial position.
 * 
 * Then, there are 8 rows of 8 characters each, not including newlines, with letters used
 * to represent chess pieces as follows: <br>
 * 		P - Pawn <br>
 * 		R - Rook <br>
 * 		N - Knight <br>
 * 		B - Bishop <br>
 * 		Q - Queen <br>
 * 		K - King <br>
 * 		X - empty square <br>
 * 		E - en passant square (see below) <br>
 * UPPERCASE letters represent white pieces <br>
 * LOWERCASE letters represent black pieces <br>
 * 'E' - represents an en passant square. That is, if the LAST MOVE made was by a pawn
 * moving two squares ahead, an E should be placed on the square the pawn hopped over.
 * <br>
 * The board should be oriented the same way as the actual board, from
 * white's perspective. That is, the first line of the file should be black's
 * back row and  the last line white's back row.<br>
 * 
 * Finally, the last line should contain either 0 or 1; 0 if it is currently white's turn,
 * 1 if it is currently black's turn. <br>
 * 
 * As an example, this is what a board file would look like before any moves have
 * been made: <br>
 * <br>
 * 1
 * 1
 * 1
 * 1
 * rnbqkbnr <br>
 * pppppppp <br>
 * XXXXXXXX <br>
 * XXXXXXXX <br>
 * XXXXXXXX <br>
 * XXXXXXXX <br>
 * PPPPPPPP <br>
 * RNBQKBNR <br>
 * 0
