	/**
	 * Compute all squares that this piece is PROTECTING. A protected
	 * square is a square that this piece is preventing the enemy king
	 * from moving to. In other words, it's a square that the enemy
	 * king can't move to, lest he put himself in check.
	 * 
	 * We note that there is a subtlety to this definition when talking
	 * about Kings. In particular, a King can be protecting a square without
	 * being able to move there. For example, suppose there's a white King,
	 * and there's a black Rook in the row in front of it, preventing it
	 * from moving forward. Suppose the black King is two squares in front of
	 * the white King:
	 * 
	 * k - Black king
	 * XXXr - Black rook
	 * K - White king
	 * 
	 * Then the White King can't move forward without placing himself in check,
	 * and if there was a black piece directly in front of him he wouldn't be able
	 * to take it. Regardless, the black King can't move to the square in front of
	 * the white King either, because then he'd be under attack by the white King.
	 * 
	 * All this to say that a King's protected squares are all those squares around
	 * him which are either empty or occupied by an ally.
	 * 
	 * @return A list of Pairs, where each pair represents a square protected by
	 * this piece
